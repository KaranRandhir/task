      CUSTOM DUTY<br/> 
      Customs means Govt. service which is responsible for the use of customs law and regulation to collect duties and taxes. It also has responsibility to use of other laws & regulations related to import, export, transportation or storage of products. Customs has been treated as the Ô¨Åscal subject (topic) that charges customs duties and other taxes on export or import.

<br/><br/>
Customs Duty is a special type of tariÔ¨Ä or tax imposed on goods when exported or imported across international borders. Objective Customs Duty is to protect each country‚Äôs economy, residents, jobs, environment, etc., by controlling the export and import of products/items, mainly restrictive and prohibited goods, into and out of the nation.
Each product/item has a predeÔ¨Åned rate of customs duty that is determined based on several factors, including where such product/ item was acquired, where such products were made, & what these products is made of. Alongside, anything that you bring into any country for the Ô¨Årst time should be declared as per the customs rules. For example, you should need to declare the items/products purchased in a foreign country and any gifts which you get or buy outside India.
<br></br><br/>

All the matters related to it in India come under the (CBEC) Central Board of Excise and Customs. CBEC has created policies that are used for collection or levying of customs duties, duty evasion, smuggling prevention & administrative decisions related to customs laws and regulations. CBEC has diÔ¨Äerent divisions for diÔ¨Äerent works related to Custom duty on import or export of products in or out of India.
<br/><br/>
Custom Import Duty In India
<br/>
Custom import duty is a tax collected on imports of goods by (any country‚Äôs customs authorities)
 Indian customs authorities when goods imported Ô¨Årst time into India (any country). 
 Import duty mainly depends on the good‚Äôs value.
  Depending on the context, import duty may also be called as a customs duty, custom tariÔ¨Ä, and import tax or 
  import tariÔ¨Ä.
<br/><br/>
DETAILS ABOUT CUSTOM DUTIES  Basic :
<br/>
Basic duty is applied on imported items/products that come under the ambit of Section 12 of the Customs Act,
1962. These custom duties are imposed at the rates prescribed in First Schedule to Customs TariÔ¨Ä Act, 1975, under the
terms/products speciÔ¨Åed in Section 2 of the act. The levied rates can be standard or preferential as per the nation of import.
<br/><br/>
Additional (Countervailing Duty (CVD)) : 
<br/>
This duty is imposed on imported items under Section 3 of Customs TariÔ¨Ä Act, 1975. It is equivalent to the Central Excise Duty that is applicable on similar goods produced within India. This duty is calculated on the aggregate value of goods including BDC and landing charges.
Protective Duty : Protective duty may be applied to shield the domestic industry against imports at a rate recommended by the TariÔ¨Ä Commissioner.
Education Cess : This is applied at 2% and higher education cess at another 1% of the aggregate of customs duties. Anti-dumping Duty : Anti-dumping duty may be levied if the good being imported is at below fair market rate, and is limited to the diÔ¨Äerence between export & normal price (dumping margin).
Safeguard Duty : Safeguard duty is applied if the government feels that a sudden increase in exports can potentially damage the domestic industry of the country
<br/><br/>

CUSTOM DUTY CALCULATIONS<br/>
 Custom duties are evaluated on speciÔ¨Åc or ad valorem basis, i.e. on the value of goods.
  The value of product/goods is determined by Rule 3(i) of Customs Valuation 
  (Determination of Value of Goods Imported by someone) Rules, 2007. 
  This rule Ô¨Åxes the value of imported goods at the transaction value that has been 
  adjusted as per the provisions under Rule 10. If there are no quantiÔ¨Åable or objective 
  data related the valuation factors, valuation conditions are not satisÔ¨Åed, or there are some 
  doubts regarding the accuracy or truth of declared value as per Rule 12 of Valuation Rules 2007, 
  valuation of items/products has to be done through other means as per the below given hierarchy 
  (sequence of steps),
Comparative Value Method which compares the transaction value of similar products/items (Rule 4)
Comparative Value Method which compares the transaction value of similar products/items (Rule 5)
Deductive Value Method which uses the sale rate of the item in importing country (Rule 7)
Computed Value Method which utilizes the costs related to fabrication, materials, and proÔ¨Åt in the production country (Rule 8)
Fall-back method which is based on the previous methods with higher Ô¨Çexibility (Rule 9)
<br/><br/>
